## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## This should probably be at the top. I should add another one of these up there 
### My favourite things about CS193:

- The esteemed and distinguished scholars that are our professors (yes, I am sucking up)
- The comfortable class environment
- How approachable you guys are
- How easy the quizzes are(pls don't change this)
- The 3rd lightbulb from the left in the frontmost row is very cool
- The jokes

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
